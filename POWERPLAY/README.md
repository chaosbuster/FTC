# COACH'S BOT

## PROGRAMMING GOAL
One of the goals in how the code for our Coach's Bot is written is to explore with team members options for using different levels of coding.  
On our teams we have seen a broad spectrum of programming skills and yet our teams feel like they have to chose ONE programming environment.
Throughout our Coach's bot code set we are pushing the limits to using both Blocks WITH Java. 

By sharing these examples we hope that all team members will find a way to contribute regardless of skill set and programming interest.  
This will also help programming teams to work towards planning out their logical design and how components / classes interact.  ;-)
