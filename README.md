# What is this?  A Coach's Bot?

On our Bearbotics FTC teams we have many rookies that join one of our three high school teams.  Our intent on our FTC teams is to provide an opportunity for team members to:

- explore career interests
- build their capabilities for working as a team
- use an Engineering Process
- ...and yes, be competitive


Our Coach's bot was started during the 2022-2023 POWERPLAY season. As Coaches a key principle we want to achieve is letting the teams have control over their designs, implementation plan, mechanicals and programming.  To help with this principle and yet help our teams move forward together we felt a Coach's bot could offer an opportunity for exploring options (mechanical, programming, strategy) with the students without getting our hands on a team's bot.
